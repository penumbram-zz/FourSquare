###   FourSquare trending place searcher with coordinates. ### 
This application will do an authentication with FourSquare to do some things that can be already done in FourSquare, but with a really worse graphical design and probably worse Objective-C design.

### This repository exists to: ###

* Show my work
* Get a good grade
* And get one of [this](http://www.yalova.edu.tr/Files/Import/ucgen3/userfiles/1(21).jpg)

### Version 0.1 ###

* Foursquare authentication

*  UICollectionView implementation

### Version 1.0 ###

* Foursquare authentication

* Gets latitude and longitude values from the keyboard and searches trending places for the current date

* Displays the trending places in a UICollectionView with reusable cells.(1/5 api requests)

* If the user taps on one of the cells, Detailed information about the place pops in a UIView with more options

* Those options include: 

- Like (2/5 api requests)
- Dislike (2/5 api requests)
- See place Images (in a UIImageView) (3/5 api requests)
- See similar places in the UICollectionView (4/5 api requests)
- See next places (A foursquare feature i learnt about during the development phase) (5/5 api requests)

I did lots of googling during the development and received no help from any third party developer (except stackoverflow ofcourse)

Thanks for reviewing my work, if a problem occurs you can send me and e-mail and i will respond to it a.s.a.p
All the features i mention are tested and work fine, if any of them seem to not work, that could be caused by a bad commit - push in which case i would be glad to send the project in a mail attachment.
